# Carpenter's Blocks
This is a fork of [Mineshopper/carpentersblocks](https://github.com/Mineshopper/carpentersblocks). It has been disconnected to avoid accidental upstream pull requests.

This is a Minecraft Forge mod that adds slopes and a variety of vanilla inspired blocks that support covers, side covers, overlays, dyes and chiseled patterns.
